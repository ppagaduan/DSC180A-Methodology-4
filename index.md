**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter has been the correlations between different target maps and the source map.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
One potential investigation I would like to pursue for my Quarter 2 project would be a predictor that takes in different brains maps and describes the possibility of having neurocognitive issues.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
One potential change I would make to the approach taken in my current Quarter 1 Project would be to incorporate a more interactive element to the results we are modeling.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
Some other technique that I would be interested in using in my project would be to incorporate different source maps into our project and to experiment with different ways to report the statistical significance of each correlation.
